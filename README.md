# Happy-Sad-Image-Classifier
# Emotion Classification using Deep Learning

This project demonstrates a deep learning model that classifies images of people into two categories: Happy and Sad. The model was trained on a dataset of facial expressions and uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict emotions based on input images.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of images sourced from the internet, featuring people displaying different emotions (happy and sad).
